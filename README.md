## üìú Getting Started

### `1.1` Installation

Clone this repository into your preferred directory using Git:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/TrueMyst/BeatPrints.git && cd BeatPrints
```

### `1.2` Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This ensures all required packages are installed to run the project smoothly.

### `1.3` Environment Variables

To run this project, you need to create a `.env` file to set up the required environmental variables. These include:

- **SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID** and **SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET**, which can be obtained from [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you select **Web API** as the scope of the application.

You can find an example `.env` file [here](https://github.com/TrueMyst/BeatPrints/tree/main/{example}.env). Rename this file to `.env` and use it as needed.

### `1.4` Generating Posters

Navigate to the [cli](https://github.com/TrueMyst/BeatPrints/tree/main/cli/) directory and execute the following command:

```bash
$ python3 prompt.py
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ```bash
> KeyError: 'setting text direction, language or font features is not supported without libraqm'.
> ```
>
> If you're on Windows, you may encounter this problem. You can resolve this issue, by installing `fribidi.dll` for Pillow to handle complicated texts. Download the required file from [here](https://www.dllme.com/dll/files/fribidi) and place it in the following directory: `C:\Program Files\Python312\`
>
> If you're on macOS, you can fix this issue by running these commands:

## ü§ù Contributing

## üí° Inspiration & Gratitude

I created this project after finding out that people sell these posters on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/market/spotify_poster) at high prices, offering only digital downloads instead of shipping actual posters. I wanted to make it free for everyone to print themselves, and I believe my posters are simpler, cleaner, and prettier.
